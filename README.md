# IsPrime
This is a short Python code to verify if a number is prime or not

In the repository you will find a file named IsPrime.py and if you download it you can use it.

 ### Instructions:
* Open the IsPrime.py file with an interpreter (like Visual Studio Code).
* Write a new line with: IsPrime().
* Inside the parentheses, you can write any number you like, and it will tell you whether or not it is a prime number.
* To run it, you can press Ctrl + Enter or right-click and select "Run in Terminal".


I hope you like it!
